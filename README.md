## Development
Created in RPG Maker MV, this engine aims to recreate SNES style Dragon Quest games but with mechanics and features from multiple games.
The battle mechanics are intended to be closer to DQ11 than any other game.

Changes to the RPG Maker engine can be found in JS/Plugins.

## Builds
A pre-alpha build can be found in the releases.
Have a go running around on the debug map!
