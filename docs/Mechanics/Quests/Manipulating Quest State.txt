Objective has FLAG

no flag = _completed bool is set manually at some point
(e.g. "Talk to the man by the bridge")

'XXX' flag = _completed bool set in a function that is passed,
			 as params, which flags to check. If flags matched,
			 it is removed and _completed is set to TRUE


$gameParty -> quests:
all active/completed quests

$gameParty -> availableQuests:
all quests that haven't been started but can be accessed

$gameParty -> activeQuestFlags:
this is an ARRAY of objective flags that are currently active.
When a new quest is activated OR a new stage of a quest is reached,
the objectives of that stage have their flags pushed to activeQuestFlags.

After certain in game events a function is run to check if active flags
need to be completed. (e.g. after a battle where an enemy was killed, the function should run with a param 'XXX' flag (the flag for defeating an enemy) & if that flag is found in activeQuestFlags then the objective should be updated)
