- Objectives can have FLAGs
* no flag = objective set to 1 is done manually at some point
	(e.g. "Talk to the man by the bridge")
* 'XXX' flag = objective set to 1 is done in functions after certain events
	(e.g. battles, levelling, unlocking skills, etc.)
===========

1. Events look for keywords in flags
	(e.g. battles look through AQF for flags with "BATTLE" prefix)
2. Event checks if that flag has been done
	(e.g. at end of battle, have 3 enemies been defeated?)
3. If so, loop through that flags slot in AQF and complete objectives listed in array
===========

$gameParty -> quests:
all active/completed quests

$gameParty -> availableQuests:
all quests that haven't been started but can be accessed

$gameParty -> activeQuestFlags:
* array of flags looking to be completed
* each flag is array containing:
	- FLAG_NAME: always at index 0
	- array containing Quest ID, Stage Index & Obj Index
		> this shows which objectives should be completed when this flag is achieved
* upon new quest, quest info added to correct if flag is already in AQF array
* element in array should be deleted once objective completed
e.g.
[
	[
		"BATTLE_DEFEAT_ONE",
		[Quest ID, Stage Index, Objective Index], 
		[Quest ID, Stage Index, Objective Index]
	],
	[
		"BATTLE_DEFEAT_TWO",
		[Quest ID, Stage Index, Objective Index]
	]
]
