- windows:

{*} itemHeight func could be put into window_base?
	{**} itemRect rewrite: win_pagination, win_controls (same as selectable?), win_equipSlot
		{**} search itemRect funcs to see what needs rewriting
	{**} lineGap check if needed everywhere
	{**} statsCommon: use itemHeight() in drawNameTitle func 
	
pagination row functions clean-up

pageblockheight = 54 irrelevant as in pagination = 54

window zoom & window equipment list maxRows can be made similar

drawing prev/next page icons logic into common function

window_command overwrite windowWidth method to use this._width

itemRect function in selectable should have +extraPadding for x & y

refactor pagination itemRect function (rect height is weird?)
