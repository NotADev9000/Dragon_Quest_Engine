- windows:

drawing prev/next page icons logic into common function

itemRect functions could be rewritten to include page/title/extra blocks:
 - start with selectable
 - itemRect function in selectable should have +extraPadding for x & y
 - refactor pagination itemRect function (rect height is weird?)

window_command:
 - overhaul so width is different for each instance (passed in on init)
 - updateWindowDisplay can probs be removed
	- will need adjustments in used scenes
