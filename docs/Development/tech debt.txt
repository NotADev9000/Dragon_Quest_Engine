itemRect functions could be rewritten to include page/title/extra blocks:
 - refactor pagination itemRect function (rect height is weird?)
 - look at "TECH DEBT" markers related to itemRect refactoring
 - look into tidying up page/title/extra functions
	* should be consistent what each one is used for
