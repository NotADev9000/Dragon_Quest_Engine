- windows:

itemRect functions could be rewritten to include page/title/extra blocks
 - start with selectable
	
pagination row functions clean-up

pageblockheight = 54 irrelevant as in pagination = 54

window zoom & window equipment list maxRows can be made similar

drawing prev/next page icons logic into common function

window_command overwrite windowWidth method to use this._width

itemRect function in selectable should have +extraPadding for x & y

refactor pagination itemRect function (rect height is weird?)
