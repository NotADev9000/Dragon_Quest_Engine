- windows:

itemRect functions could be rewritten to include page/title/extra blocks:
 - start with selectable
 - itemRect function in selectable should have +extraPadding for x & y
 - refactor pagination itemRect function (rect height is weird?)

look into tidying up page/title/extra functions
 - should be consistent what each one is used for
