- windows:

itemRect functions could be rewritten to include page/title/extra blocks
 - start with selectable
 - itemRect function in selectable should have +extraPadding for x & y
 - refactor pagination itemRect function (rect height is weird?)

window zoom & window equipment list maxRows can be made similar

drawing prev/next page icons logic into common function

window_command overwrite windowWidth method to use this._width
