- icons:

option in game to switch between keyboard & gamepad icons

- windows:

split DQE_Windows into individual files

linegap = 15 irrelevant as in window_base = 15

standardpadding = 24 irrelevant as in window_base = 24 (for most windows, NOT all!)

itemHeight func could be put into window_base?

pageblockheight = 54 irrelevant as in pagination = 54

window zoom & window equipment list maxRows can be made similar

drawing prev/next page icons logic into common function

window_command overwrite windowWidth method to use this._width

make window_settings an abstract class

itemRect function in selectable should have +extraPadding for x & y
