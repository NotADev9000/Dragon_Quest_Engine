Skill Sets in JS:
- game_actor:
	+ skill points
	+ skill sets

$dataSkillSets
+ skill set:
	- ID (generally same as name)
	- name
	- layers:[
		+ layer X:
			+ layer unlock cost
				- certain amount of skills from previous layer
				  must be bought to unlock this layer
			+ nodes:[
				- node:
					+ name: (leave blank for skill name)
					+ unlocks:
						- skills, stats, weapon use
					+ cost
						- sp, gold?, m-medals?
			]
	]
	

- dataManager makes $dataSkillSets from json (contains all skill sets)
- (^ set the nodes & layers to locked)
- (^ set the layers & sets to incomplete)
- dataManager adds skillsets ID to $dataActors object
- game_actor setup initiates actors' skillsets
